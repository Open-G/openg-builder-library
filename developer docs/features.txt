1) GUI Design should be simula to LV-AB but the windows (and objects) should be scaleable
2) New feature to DEAB should be handling of LabVIEW DSC build
3) LVDSC should show in the GUI as a TAB, if DSC is NOT installed then the TAB is GRAY
4) When building apps. incl. LVDSC OPC/VI servers DEAB should also be able to register servers and move them to the runtime lib. (options)
4.1) LVDSC OPC/VI servers should also be able to unregister servers 
5) General, visuel and "intelligent" Error handling is a must
6) The window/table showing all the VI's / files incl. in the build should be sortable and it should possible to change attributes on more files at the same time
7) Windows Explorer function that opens Explorer in different directories, e.g. "Explorer Runtime dir", Explorer support file dir" and so on.
8) We should work hard on Optimizing the build speed !!! this is really important
