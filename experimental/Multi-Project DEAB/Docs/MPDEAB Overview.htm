<h3> MPDEAB Overview</h3>
The Multi-Project DEAB (MPDEAB) is a tool intended to help manage multiple dependent deab
projects. In some sense, it is similar to MAKE utility of the C.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>How it works</h3>
<p>MPDEAB uses an <a href="MPDEAB%20Project%20File%20Dscr.htm">MPDEAB Project File</a>
to accept description of DEAB Project dependencies and store working information
(like time stamps).</p>
<p>There are two kinds of dependencies:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A DEAB Project depends on other DEAB Project(s). It means that the target
    of a DEAB file is to be built if the DEAB Timestamp is less than a time
    stamp of any of DEAB Projects it depends on. MPDEAB controls DEAB Timestamps
    and stores them in <a href="MPDEAB%20Project%20File%20Dscr.htm">MPDEAB
    Project File</a>.<br>
  </li>
  <li>A DEAB Project depends on arbitrary file(s). It means that the target of a
    DEAB file is to be built if the DEAB Timestamp is less than a time stamp
    of any of files it depends on. MPDEAB retrieves files' time stamps from an OS File System, it does not control files' time stamps.</li>
</ul>
<p>MPDEAB can treat either all DEAB Projects in a <a href="MPDEAB%20Project%20File%20Dscr.htm">MPDEAB
    Project File</a> or only requested one(s). When MPDEAB is run to process a
project file, it analyzes dependency hierarchies of the requested DEAB Projects,
and determines a set of DEAB Projects involved and an order to treat them. The
deeper a DEAB Project is in a hierarchy, the earlier it is treated. This way, if
a DEAB Project need be built, all its dependents (both direct and indirect) in
the requested hierarchies should be build as well.</p>
<h4>Parameters</h4>
<p>MPDEAB accepts the parameters:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>MPDEAB Project File</b> (required)</li>
  <li><b>DEAB File Tags</b> specifies desired DEAB Projects to process. If it is
    not specified (by default), MPDEAB treats all DEAB Projects of the project
    file.</li>
  <li><b>Mode</b> specifies a processing mode. Available modes are described
    below.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Working modes</h4>
<p><b>Build</b><br>
MPDEAB checks which DEAB Projects in the given hierarchies are out-of-date (need
be built), and builds only out-of-date DEAB Projects. All successfully built
DEAB Projects accept new time stamp. If an error occurred while a build of a
DEAB Project, MPDEAB terminates processing. A report is written to a log file.</p>
<p><b>Build always</b><br>
MPDEAB ignores any time stamps and builds all DEAB Projects in the given
hierarchies. A report is written to a log file. All successfully built DEAB
Projects accept new time stamp. If an error occurred while a build of a DEAB
Project, MPDEAB terminates processing. A report is written to a log file.</p>
<p><b>Check w/o build</b><br>
MPDEAB checks which DEAB Projects in the given hierarchies are out-of-date (need
be built), but does not perform a build; time stamps are not changed as well. A
report is written to a log file.</p>
<p><b>Update time stamps</b><br>
MPDEAB sets time stamps of all DEAB Projects in the given hierarchies to
up-to-date value. A report is written to a log file.</p>
<p><b>Reset time stamps</b><br>
MPDEAB sets time stamps of all DEAB Projects in the given hierarchies to
out-of-date value. A report is written to a log file.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Glossary</h3>
<p><b>MPDEAB
    Project File</b> is a file that contains information on DEAB Projects and
their dependencies.</p>
<p><b>DEAB File Tag</b> is a unique identifier specified in MPDEAB Project File
and associated with a DEAB Build File. A DEAB File Tag is used to refer to the
respective DEAB Build File in a project file and in a MPDEAB call.</p>
<p><b>DEAB Project</b>  term is associated with a DEAB Build File specified in a
MPDEAB
    Project File and a target application of the DEAB Build File. See DEAB
documentation for more information.</p>
<p><b>DEAB Timestamp</b>  is a time stamp assigned to a DEAB Project and stored
in a MPDEAB
    Project File. MPDEAB updates a DEAB Timestamp if the DEAB Project is
successfully built.</p>
