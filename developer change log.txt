* [CHANGE] OpenG Builder's self-builder no longer calls OpenG Builder by reference, since the Builder now builds applications in a private context.
* [CHANGE] Set Builder version to 3.0 and reset build number
* [CHANGE] OpenG Builder build rules now excludes vi.lib from build.
* [CHANGE] Building in of NI (vi.lib) VIs during mass compile is no longer occurring (but is still optional, via a Boolean constant).
